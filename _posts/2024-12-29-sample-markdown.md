This is a special message written with lots of love for your special day. Wishing you the happiest birthday and an amazing year ahead! ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Happy Birthday, Pavana! üéâ

I don't say it enough, but I truly value having you in my life with all my heart. Just having someone who understands me and can objectively tell me when I'm wrong is such a blessing. The way we communicate feels so natural and easy, and I'm so glad we overcame the initial roadblock where we used to bottle up our feelings.  

I remember when everything used to feel overwhelming, and being in the relationship felt frustrating at times because we didn't speak our minds to each other. I'm so thankful we got through that phase and grew into a relationship where we complement and appreciate one another as independent individuals. We've always rued the long distance, and while it is challenging, the very foundation of our relationship makes it so much easier to handle.  

### Now, talking about you... xD  

I am so proud of everything you've accomplished. To be in the position you're in, so early in your career, is amazing. It's no wonder they rely on you so much at work. It's also incredibly inspiring how you always pick yourself up after setbacks‚Äîeven though it might take some time (many times, xD). You always get through it, and it's something I deeply admire. Being there for you, just as you're always there for me, is something I truly cherish.  

You've been such a strong pillar of support in my life and have played a huge role in shaping who I am today. You‚Äôve helped me open up more and be honest about my feelings‚Äîsomething I never used to do‚Äîso thank you for that.  

## Have the best day and the best year ahead!  

I can't wait to see you very, very soon!  

Love you and miss you so much! ‚ù§Ô∏è  

**Yours,**  
Kiwi
